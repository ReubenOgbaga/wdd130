            <p>
                Hello! My name is <strong>Reuben Chiadikaobi Oagbga</strong>. I am currently a student, 
                and I am learning web development as part of my WDD 130 course. I am the first child born to 
                a family of eight, so I enjoy leading others and working in groups to achieve a common goal. My hobbies include; listening to good music, watching football games, learning new things, and teaching others. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my creativity and problem-solving skills. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and building useful applications.
