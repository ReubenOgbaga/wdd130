            Hello! My name is <strong>Reuben Chiadikaobi Oagbga</strong>. I am currently a student, 
            and I am learning web development as part of my WDD 130 course. I am the first child born to 
            a family of eight, so I enjoy leading others and working in groups to achieve a common goal.
            My hobbies include; listening to good music, watching football games, learning new things,
            and teaching others. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my creativity and 
            problem-solving skills. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and building 
            useful applications.
